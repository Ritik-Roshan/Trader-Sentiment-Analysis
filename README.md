This project analyzes how trader sentiment (fear or greed) influences trading behavior using a combination of market sentiment data and historical trader data. The objective is to build a classification model that can predict trader sentiment and explore how it affects trading outcomes.


# üìå Datasets Used

# üß† Methodology
**Data Loading & Cleaning**
- Merged sentiment data with trader performance based on date.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized class distribution, trends, and correlations
    
- Checked for missing values and outliers

**Feature Engineering**
- Categorical encoding
  
- Date feature extraction
  
- Sentiment labeling

**Modeling**
- Random Forest Classifier

- Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision

**Results**
- Accuracy: ~76%

- Best performance on classifying traders during Fear sentiment
